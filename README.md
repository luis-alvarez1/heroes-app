# StarWarsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4. and developed by **Christian Ladino** and **Luis Alvarez**

## Previous Settings

### Before you can run the app, you will need a **_Node.js_** and **_npm_** (or **_yarn_**) version installed to run the following commands.

- To install all dependencies, run either `npm install` or `yarn instal`. This will generate the **_node_modules_** folder where all **libraries** and **dependencies** will be located. Once all dependencies are installed, you can go to the next step, run the app.

## Running the Web App

Run either `npm start` or `ng serve -o` to run the app (you can also use `yarn start`, as you prefer). It will automatically open a new browser tab with the following url -> `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
